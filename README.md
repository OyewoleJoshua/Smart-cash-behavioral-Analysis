# SmartCash Behavioral Analysis

This project presents a personal behavioral analysis based on transaction data from the **Airtel SmartCash Wallet**. The objective was to clean, organize, analyze, and visualize real-world financial data using Microsoft Excel to uncover actionable insights about spending habits and behavioral triggers.

## Project Objective

To understand personal financial behavior using transaction records, with the goal of answering:

1. How much was spent on data subscriptions?
2. What was the total amount transferred into the wallet?
3. On which days were top-ups most frequent, and what prompted those actions?
4. What were the most frequent transaction categories?

## Tools Used

- Microsoft Excel  
  - Power Query – for data cleaning and transformation  
  - Pivot Tables – for summarizing and analyzing key metrics  
  - Excel Charts – for visualizing insights

## Data Source

The data consisted of personal Airtel SmartCash transaction records, exported from a **PDF** file. The raw data was unstructured and required significant cleaning before analysis.

## Data Cleaning Process

All cleaning and transformation were conducted in Microsoft Excel, following these steps:

1. **PDF to Excel Conversion**  
   Exported the original PDF statement into Excel. The resulting data had formatting inconsistencies, unwanted headers, and unstructured rows.

2. **Data Cleaning Using Power Query**  
   - Removed non-data elements (headers/footers)  
   - Standardized and parsed **dates**, **transaction descriptions**, and **amounts**  
   - Removed **duplicates**, filtered **outliers**, and ensured column consistency

3. **Data Structuring**  
   Corrected data types and created usable column formats for easier analysis.

## Data Analysis and Visualization

Using **Pivot Tables** and **Excel Charts**, the cleaned dataset was analyzed and visualized to generate insights on:

- Total spending on subscriptions  
- Total amount sent to the wallet  
- Frequency of wallet top-ups by day  
- Top transaction categories  

## Key Insights

- **Wallet Spending vs. Funding**: Spending exceeded wallet top-ups due to accumulated **bonus credits** automatically applied during transactions. These bonus funds significantly subsidized the actual spend.

- **Recharge Patterns**: Wallet top-ups occurred more frequently on days when bonus-related SMS messages were received. These notifications acted as **behavioral triggers**.

- **Transaction Behavior**: A majority of funds were used for **data subscriptions**, with two consistent transaction types accounting for most activity.

## Recommendation

To increase engagement and usage frequency, **Airtel** could enhance the visibility and frequency of **bonus SMS notifications**. The analysis shows that these messages drive user behavior and top-up activity.

## Lessons Learned

This project reinforced several key data skills:

- Working with **real, messy data**  
- Using **Power Query** for transformation and cleanup  
- Applying **Pivot Tables** and **Excel Charts** to generate structured insights and visualizations  

Analyzing personal financial data—especially from unstructured sources like PDFs—offers practical experience far beyond textbook or tutorial datasets. It reveals behavioral trends and drives curiosity for further exploration.
